```

There are three folder name `Pi3` and `Pi4` and `Pi4-64-beta`, If you are using  Raspberry Pi3 and older device, please follow the README file in `Pi3` folder. And if you are using Raspberry Pi4 32bit OS, then follow the README file in `Pi4` folder. And if you are using Raspberry Pi4 64bit OS, then follow the `README` file in `Pi4-64-beta` folder.

if you run bullseye system and you get blank screen, better to comment out below in `/boot/config.txt` file. Don't have a better solution now, i will keep looking into it.

## 5. How to change backlight

### Step 1. Install pigpio

First we need to install pigpio library, you can follow the instruction [here](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html).

```
wget https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd pigpio-master
make
sudo make install
```

If the Python part of the install fails it may be because you need the setup tools.

```
sudo apt install python-setuptools python3-setuptools
```

### Step 2. Copy `backlight.py` to your pi

There is `backlight.py` file in the repo, copy it to`/home/pi` path

### Step 3. Enable `backlight.service`

Copy the `backlight.service` file in this repo to `/etc/systemd/system`

```pigpiod
sudo cp backlight.service /etc/sysetmd/system/backlight.service
```

inform `systemd` that a new service has been added. This is done with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Now you can attempt to start the service using the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start backlight.service
```

Enable it to run at boot

```
sudo systemctl enable backlight.service
```

### Step 4. Change backlight value

```
nano /home/pi/backlight.py
```

change `128` to the value you want.

### Step 5. Reboot

```
sudo reboot
```
